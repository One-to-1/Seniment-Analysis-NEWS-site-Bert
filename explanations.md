I apologize for the confusion. Let's break down the code in more detail:

1. Importing necessary libraries:
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
```
`BeautifulSoup` is a Python library used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. `requests` is a Python library used for making HTTP requests.

2. Fetching the webpage:
```python
page = requests.get('https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/growth-of-eight-core-sectors-at-6-7-in-feb-as-against-4-1-in-jan/articleshow/108852450.cms').text
```
`requests.get()` sends a GET request to the specified URL and returns a response. `.text` returns the text content of the response.

3. Parsing the webpage:
```python
content = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
```
`BeautifulSoup()` is a function that parses the HTML content. It takes two arguments: the HTML content to be parsed and the parser library to be used ('html.parser' in this case).

4. Finding all script blocks of type 'application/ld+json':
```python
script = content.find_all('script', {'type': 'application/ld+json'})
```
`find_all()` is a BeautifulSoup function that finds all instances of a tag in the parsed HTML. It takes two arguments: the tag to be found ('script' in this case) and a dictionary of attributes to match ({'type': 'application/ld+json'} in this case).

5. Importing the `json` library:
```python
import json
```
`json` is a Python library used for working with JSON data.

6. Initializing an empty list to store the desired script block:
```python
newsScriptBlock = []
```
This line initializes an empty list to store the script blocks that match the desired criteria.

7. Iterating over each script block:
```python
for s in script:
    content = json.loads(s.string)
    if '@type' in content and content['@type'] == 'NewsArticle':
        newsScriptBlock.append(s)
```
`json.loads()` is a function that parses a JSON string and converts it into a Python object. `s.string` returns the string content of the script block. The `if` statement checks if the '@type' key exists in the content and if its value is 'NewsArticle'. If both conditions are met, the script block is appended to `newsScriptBlock`.

8. Initializing an empty list to store the extracted data:
```python
extractedArticle = []
```
This line initializes an empty list to store the extracted data.

9. Iterating over each script block in `newsScriptBlock`:
```python
for s in newsScriptBlock:
    content = json.loads(s.string)
    extractedArticle.append({
        content.get('articleBody', '')
    })
```
This block of code is similar to the previous one, but instead of checking for a specific '@type', it extracts the 'articleBody' key from the content and appends it to `extractedArticle`. If 'articleBody' does not exist, an empty string is appended instead.

10. Importing more libraries:
```python
import re
import nltk
import pandas as pd
```
`re` is a Python library used for working with regular expressions. `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) is a Python library used for working with human language data. `pandas` is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.

11. Initializing an empty list to store the sentences:
```python
sentences = []
```
This line initializes an empty list to store the sentences.

12. Iterating over each article in `extractedArticle`:
```python
for article in extractedArticle:
    article_string = next(iter(article))
    cleaned_string = re.sub(r'Rs\.', 'Rs', article_string)
    article_sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(cleaned_string)
    sentences.append(article_sentences)
```
`next(iter(article))` returns the first item in `article`. `re.sub()` is a function that replaces all occurrences of a pattern in a string. We are using this because we don't want the period in `Rs.` to be taken as as the ending of a sentence `nltk.sent_tokenize()` is a function that splits a text into sentences. The sentences are then appended to `sentences`.

13. Flattening the list of sentences:
```python
sentences = [sentence for sublist in sentences for sentence in sublist]
```
This line uses a list comprehension to flatten the list of sentences. 
Flattening a list in Python refers to the process of converting a list of lists (or a nested list) into a single, flat list. 

The `sentences` list is a list of lists, where each sublist contains sentences from a single article. The line of code:

```python
sentences = [sentence for sublist in sentences for sentence in sublist]
```

is using a list comprehension to "flatten" this list of lists. It iterates over each sublist in `sentences` and then over each `sentence` in that sublist. The result is a new list that contains all the sentences from all the articles, without any nested structure. 

For example, if `sentences` was initially:

```python
[['sentence 1 from article 1', 'sentence 2 from article 1'], ['sentence 1 from article 2', 'sentence 2 from article 2']]
```

After flattening, `sentences` would be:

```python
['sentence 1 from article 1', 'sentence 2 from article 1', 'sentence 1 from article 2', 'sentence 2 from article 2']
```

This makes it easier to process all the sentences together in the subsequent steps of the code.

14.  Converting the list of sentences into a pandas DataFrame:
```python
df = pd.DataFrame(sentences, columns=['sentence'])
```
`pd.DataFrame()` is a function that creates a DataFrame from a list. The `columns` argument specifies the column labels.

15.  Importing more libraries:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import scipy
import torch
```
`transformers` is a Python library used for state-of-the-art natural language processing. `scipy` is a Python library used for scientific computing. `torch` is a Python library used for machine learning.

16.  Loading the pretrained FinBERT model and tokenizer:
```python
X = df['sentence'].to_list()
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("ProsusAI/finbert")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("ProsusAI/finbert")
```
`df['sentence'].to_list()` converts the 'sentence' column of the DataFrame to a list. `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()` and `AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained()` are functions that load the pretrained FinBERT tokenizer and model, respectively.

17.  Making sentiment predictions:
```python
preds = []
preds_proba = []
scoresList = []
tokenizer_kwargs = {"padding": True, "truncation": True, "max_length": 512}
for x in X:
    with torch.no_grad():
        input_sequence = tokenizer(x, return_tensors="pt", **tokenizer_kwargs)
        logits = model(**input_sequence).logits
        scores = {
        k: v
        for k, v in zip(
            model.config.id2label.values(),
            scipy.special.softmax(logits.numpy().squeeze()),
        )
    }
    sentimentFinbert = max(scores, key=scores.get)
    probabilityFinbert = max(scores.values())
    scoresList.append(scores)
    preds.append(sentimentFinbert)
    preds_proba.append(probabilityFinbert)
```
This block of code tokenizes each sentence, feeds it into the model, computes the softmax of the output logits, and stores the predicted sentiment and its probability. `torch.no_grad()` is a context manager that disables gradient calculation, which is not needed during inference. `tokenizer()` tokenizes the input sentence. `model()` feeds the tokenized input into the model. `scipy.special.softmax()` applies the softmax function to the output logits. `max()` returns the key/value with the highest value.

18.  Creating the output DataFrame:
```python
Output = pd.DataFrame({
    'X': X,
    'preds': preds,
    'preds_proba': preds_proba
})
scoresdf = pd.DataFrame(scoresList)
Output = pd.concat([Output, scoresdf], axis=1)
```
This block of code creates a DataFrame that contains the original sentences, their predicted sentiments, and the probabilities of each sentiment. `pd.concat()` concatenates the two DataFrames along the columns (`axis=1`).

19.  Printing the output DataFrame:
```python
print(Output)
```
This line prints the output DataFrame.
